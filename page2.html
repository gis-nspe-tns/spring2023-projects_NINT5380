            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">This research project is currently investigating the relationship between various factors influencing flood vulnerability, in Milwaukee, WI. This goal is to contribute to research that provides means for resident-ed climate resistance projects. The Urban Systems Lab in collaboration with Groundwork Milwaukee, the project used geospatial analysis to find areas in Milwaukee with overlap between Flood Exposure, contaminated brownfields, and where various dimensions of vulnerability overlap with each other. A primary focus is on deepening knowledge and understanding of the public health implications of flooding on contaminated brownfield sites and disseminating this knowledge to those most affected. Our project is focused on analyzing flood vulnerability in Milwaukee. This project is being conducted to understand how socially vulnerable populations in Milwaukee are exposed to urban flooding hazards and how they also may be exposed or at risk from contaminated sites. The next step is to currently research the overlap between flooding and contaminated brownfields. The research collaboration will provide insights into the spatial distribution of these hazards, which supports more informed decision-making regarding brownfield remediation and flood mitigation.</p>

            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">The Al Zaatari Refugee Camp in Jordan plays an important role in providing temporary shelter for Syrian refugees fleeing conflict and seeking safety. It represents the immense humanitarian challenges posed by forced displacement as one of the largest refugee camps in the world. This case study provides a valuable insight into the complexities involved in managing and supporting refugee populations, including urbanization, infrastructure, and community integration. Observing the growth, expansion, and adaptation of the refugee camps over time can allow policy makers, humanitarians, and urban planners to develop effective responses to the refugee crisis. Through the use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS), this project aims to offer a comprehensive analysis of the growth and expansion of Al Zaatari Refugee Camp in Jordan. This study focuses on three key years: 2010, 2013, and 2022, providing an insight into how the camp has adapted to the Syrian refugee crisis spatially and temporally. The purpose of this research was to contribute to the ongoing discussion surrounding forced displacement, urbanization, and humanitarian aid by exploring the evolution of the camp.</p>

            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">Food authenticity is a critical aspect of culinary culture, reflecting the preservation of traditions, cultural heritage, and community identity. The project into the spatial distribution and cultural relevance of authentic restaurants within NYC. By analyzing 3.5 million Yelp.com reviews through GIS and Python tools, this project maps food authenticity in relation to NYC's diverse cultural landscape and the role it plays in shaping community identity and urban resilience.
            <br>
            <br>
            The study revealed an uneven distribution of authentic restaurants in NYC, with certain neighborhoods, frequently ethnic enclaves, having a higher concentration. However, over half of the authentic restaurants were found in just 18 neighborhoods, indicating spatial disparity. Additionally, the analysis highlighted the underrepresentation of certain ethnic cuisines like African cuisine, underscoring the need for a more diverse culinary landscape. There is an interactive map tool using Mapbox GL designed and developed for the study, allowing users to explore authentic food options in NYC and filter results based on particular criteria.
            <br>
            <br>
            Overall, this research offers critical insights into cultural diversity, migration patterns, and socio-economic factors that shape NYC's food scene, presenting valuable information for urban planners and policymakers for cultural preservation and equitable access to authentic food.
