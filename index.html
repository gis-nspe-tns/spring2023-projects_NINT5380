            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">Chinatowns have been an integral part of American history since the 1850s and are home to millions of people. There are 83 identified Chinatowns across the United States that range between being thriving communities to nearly extinct. The preservation of Chinatowns has become especially important as these communities face rapid development and displacement. This project takes a closer examination of the issue through spatial analysis using QGIS and SocialExplorer. It first locates the 83 identified Chinatowns. Through choropleth mapping, the project analyzes how the Chinese population has changed in each state between 1870 to 2010 using U.S. Census data. Then the project examines three case studies of gentrification’s impact in different urban Chinatown communities: Washington D.C., Philadelphia, and New York City. The results underscore that comprehensive standardized spatial data at a national level is needed in order to both preserve the history of Chinatown and to empower Chinatowns as they continue to face rapid development moving forward.

            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">Initial findings in this geospatial study of New York City (NYC) tennis courts indicate populations within walking distance of these facilities are disproportionately served when compared to the total population in the metropolitan area. Spatial analysis is performed using data apportionment where we look at communities within a quarter of mile from centralized tennis facilities. While economic attributes from the 2021 American Community Survey (NYC Census Tracts) are this study’s focus, future inquiry will include additional social and demographic characteristics. 
            <br>
            <br>
            For the purpose of cursory analysis, the project scope is limited to two particular family income brackets: “$100,000 to $149,999” and “$35,000 to $49,999,” loosely representing the “average” and “vulnerable” populations of interest in this study.

            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">The rental prices in Taipei are extremely high, and while salaries are growing slowly, the rents continue to rise. This has led to increasing residential pressure for young people in the Taipei metropolitan area. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Where should I start looking for rentals? 
            <br>
            <br>
            Where can I find the most options? 
            <br>
            <br>
            These are the main questions this spatial research project seeks to answer. 
            <br>
            <br>
            According to data from 591, regardless of Taipei or New Taipei, the top three regions account for over 40% of the available rental listings, showing a significant disparity. However, it's important to note that these listings encompass a range of price points, and not all of them may be affordable options. When considering rental affordability, the ranking of available housing options in Taipei and New Taipei would be reshuffled. Interestingly, the top regions with affordable rentals are concentrated in New Taipei City, namely Banqiao, Sanchong, and Zhonghe districts.  However, there are still some available options located in the Taipei City Region, and sharing housing broadens the opportunities for millennials seeking an ideal living environment.</p>

            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">Street trees are an important part of New York City’s ecosystem, as they take in pollutants, produce oxygen, absorb stormwater, and help cool the city. Among the many stressors they face planted in the sidewalks of the city is scaffolding, which can shade trees out and is often left up for several months to several years. I conducted an analysis of dead street trees in Manhattan to see if there was a significant relationship between where trees were dying and where scaffolding had stood in the previous five years. My research showed that while there were hot spots of trees that died after being under scaffolding, there were also hot spots of trees dying that had not been under scaffolding, and that, in general, dead street trees were actually less likely to have been near a building with a scaffolding permit and more likely to have been near a building without a permit. Further research is needed to see if this analysis holds up outside of the borough of Manhattan and what other factors could be causing trees to die off in clusters.</p>

            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">Once the fourth largest lake in the world, the Aral Sea is a shell of its former self. At 1/10th its original size, climate change activists, government officials, and members of the international community have rallied to discuss solutions on saving the historic lake. As time progressed, the sea split into two sections, North and South, and the shrinking waters continued. Surrounding populations have suffered due to issues, such as desertification which has caused dust storms; water scarcity which has left many without drinking water; and loss of industry in an area that was once abundant with biodiversity. Differing approaches to the handling of the crisis has led to two different situations. There is a revival in the North Aral Sea where Kazakhstan is located, and a decay in the South Aral Sea where Uzbekistan lies. Intervention is needed to save the communities that surround the sea.</p>

            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">New York State’s climate laws are among some of the most ambitious in the nation when it comes to targets, policy, and legislation. Nevertheless, for the groups that have advocated for these wins year after year, there is concern that these laws are without substance, especially, regarding the protection of Environmental Justice Communities and Disadvantaged Communities from continued ecologically and environmentally pollutive projects. As such, this study focuses on the Catskills, a region in New York State made up of six counties (Delaware, Greene, Otsego, Schoharie, Sullivan and Ulster). This project will focus, specifically, on mapping the landfills, transfer stations, remediation parcels, and proposed developments of concern in order to identify the impacts these environmental burdens can have on the surrounding communities, with a focus on using New York State’s Potential Environmental Justice Area (PEJA) and Disadvantaged Community (DAC) data. The research has been conducted using QGIS to layer, map, and conduct statistical Environmental Risk, Land Use Issues, Climate Change, and Social and Physical Vulnerability-Exposures analysis on the New York State-sourced data.</p>
